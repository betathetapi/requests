# Beta Theta Pi organization requests

Requests to be added to the organization go here! Once you're added you'll be added to a team for your chapter, which you'll have complete control over. You should feel free to add any Beta-related code you have to the organization and invite whoever you want to your team (as long as they're a Beta).

All you have to do is [file an issue](https://github.com/betathetapi/requests/issues/new) and fill out the template. You'll be added as soon as possible!

## Maintainer

AJ Jordan of the University of Rochester Eta Chi chapter maintains this organization, which is in no way endorsed by the national Beta Theta Pi fraternity.
